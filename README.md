# Web Development Portfolio

## Description

A professional portfolio site for Nardgelen Jean Francois. This project showcases my journey and achievements as a web developer. I was motivated by the desire to showcase my skills through past work, I built this portfolio to connect with potential employers and clients. It addresses the need for a personal digital space to demonstrate my proficency with responsive web design. Through this process I have deepened my understanding of CSS, HTML, and responsive layouts.
